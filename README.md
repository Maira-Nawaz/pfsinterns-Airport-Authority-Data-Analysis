I explored Flight Delay Analysis using hashtag#PowerBI. This comprehensive analysis provided insights into various aspects of flight delays, such as pre-departure and post-arrival delays, taxi-out and taxi-in times, and overall flight statistics.

This dashboard gives a high-level overview of key airport metrics:
- 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐅𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 (𝟕.𝟑𝟒𝟑𝐊): Total flights handled.
- 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐠𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠/𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 (𝟐𝟗𝟔): Equal split of departures and arrivals.
- 𝐀𝐯𝐠. 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐲 (𝟕.𝟓𝟓 𝐦𝐢𝐧) 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐲 (𝟒.𝟐𝟗 𝐦𝐢𝐧): Key delay indicators.
- 𝐓𝐚𝐱𝐢 𝐈𝐧/𝐎𝐮𝐭 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬: Average times planes spend taxiing (6.89 min in, 16.03 min out).
- 𝐅𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡: Bar chart showing monthly flight volumes.
- 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐲 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡:  Line charts for average arrival and departure delays over the year.
- 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞/𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐲 𝐛𝐲 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: Scatter plots showing how flight distance impacts delays.
- 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐲 𝐛𝐲 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐫: Bar charts ranking airlines by average departure and arrival delays.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
-Created custom 𝐃𝐀𝐗 measures to accurately calculate and visualize delays.
-Developed an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to filter data by airlines, airports, and times, leading to actionable insights.
-Used scatter plots to analyze the relationship between flight distances and delays, providing a visual representation of the data.

The insights gained from this analysis can significantly assist airline companies in optimizing their operations, identifying frequent delay patterns, and implementing strategies for improvement.
